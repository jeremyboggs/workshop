<h1>A Discussion on Law and Conceptualizing Spatial Enforcement in Our Own Community Through GIS Mapping
</h1>

<h2><i>Workshop Overview</i></h2>

<p><b>Workshop Organization:</b> the workshop is organized and planned based on my own pedagogy and successes teaching at UVA over the last 4 years (using tools that were already created): and my own introduction to GIS mapping in Eugene (through a business contact in 2010): but mainly selfish: I want to actually do something like this while teaching: also incredibly helpful with conservative-minded community members
</p>

<p><b>Seating:</b> starts as one large circle and we break into small groups: emblematic of one large community and separate neighborhoods or districts: each group will be named after a district within the city (In this exercise we will map Charlottesville, but the workshop can be modeled around any city in the country)

<p><b>Introduction:</b> (mostly an icebreaker: 4-5 minutes) who I am and what I study, a bit about my personal experience in relation to how the carceral state enforces along lines of class, my work with imprisoned populations around the country over the last 14 years and my very limited grasp of digital humanities, but my understanding of valuable the discipline is.
</p>

<p><b>Agenda:</b> we will be working in small groups (3-5) for most of the day. I embrace a collective learning model and fully understand I will learn as much from all of you as you will from me. Our small group model will allow us to promote and offer as many unique perspectives as possible. We will discuss why laws are made and who they are designed to impact, we will map a variety of data-sets within our small groups, we will look at an overview of actual GIS mapping of Charlottesville (which will offer a range of data points) and we will conclude with a discussion on how tools like GIS mapping can help us better understand our own communities.

<h2><i>Workshop Instructions</i></h2>


<ul>
<li><b>Part 1:</b> We break into small groups (random group assignments: count from 1-5), we are assigned a Charlottesville neighborhood/ district name and begin to address questions as a group. We are given 3-4 minutes per question and then each group presents their findings. I will be writing down the answers in the front of the room as they come in.
    Questions: 
    What do laws enforce?
    Which of our community members do our laws impact the most?</li>
<li><b>Part 2:</b> We stay in our groups and hand out each participant a map of Charlottesville. We will follow a handful of prompts to color in our maps (3-5 minutes), we will then discuss our findings within our groups (3-4) minutes and finish with presenting our groups overlapping findings or disagreements with the entire classroom </li>
<li><b>Prompts:</b>
    Shade-in (Blue) the area/s of Charlottesville with the highest arrest rates
    Shade-in (Red) the area/s of Charlottesville with the highest rates of poverty
    Shade-in (Green) the area/s of Charlottesville with the highest rates of pollution
    Shade-in (Orange) the area/s of Charlottesville with the highest rates of police brutality
    Shade-in (Pink) the area/s of Charlottesville with the lowest voting rates
    </li>
<li><b>Now:</b>
    Shade-in (Yellow) the area/s of Charlottesville that have the lowest rates of arrest, poverty, pollution and police brutality
    </li>
<li><b>Part 3:</b> We will now present to the entire classroom actual GIS mapping of Charlottesville (broken up by district/ neighborhood), which will include a variety of data-sets: Arrest rates, police brutality, income level, racial demographics, school zoning and funding, grocery options, etc: talk about problematic data and reporting: and how even our own forecast/ this exercise can be problematic
<li><b>Final Questions:</b>
    How are laws enforced in Charlottesville? 
    Who do they impact the most?
    Considering the exercise, what other ways can we use GIS mapping to help us better understand our own community?
    What other demographics and data-points should be included?
    How can this tool be problematic?
    </li>
<li><b>As we conclude:</b> I offer a few hints about the enforcement of class and race lines: the history of policing in the U.S.
